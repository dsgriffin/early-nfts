# Early NFTs

Early NFTs is a repo containing various resources focused on early NFTs (firsts, relatively early tokens of a niche etc), mostly in the form of blog posts and timelines.

### Defining an NFT

In the strictest sense, an NFT is a unique 1/1 token representing ownership of something (art etc).

In common usage however, it's used to refer to any kind of tokenized asset, nonfungible or not, that is seen as collectible outside of (generally) larger supply altcoins or memecoins.

For example, semi-fungible blockchain collectibles were first popularized on Bitcoin by both Ascribe & Spells of Genesis, before exploding in popularity when the ERC-1155 standard was released on Ethereum in 2019.

The key point is that **NFTs are ownable, tradable (except soulbound tokens) tokens that represent something**.

The entries and dates in all of the timelines found here therefore go by the earliest date where the NFT itself fully existed; it could be ownable, it could be tradable (except for soulbound tokens) and it represented something.

## Timelines

Note that each timeline contains an `images/` folder; I strive to only use the original onchain/hash-matching file for each asset, but there will be the odd exception (e.g. PEPERMANENT being displayed as a .gif rather than the entire onchain .json file).

### 0xmons Onchain In Early 2021

Only 83 0xmons had their full GAN animations onchain before Nahiko released XOR (art + algo/neural onchain) on the 9th August 2021, making them the earliest known onchain AI artworks.

### Earliest Hashed NFTs On Bitcoin (2014-2018)

~99% of early Bitcoin NFTs lacked cryptographic proof linking them to the data/art they represented. This table is about the ~1%.

### Pre-Ordinals Onchain Bitcoin NFTs

Before the first Ordinals inscription (14th December 2022) there was already a small batch of onchain Bitcoin NFTs. Here they are.
