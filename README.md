NFT Timelines is a repo containing various nft timelines, specifically ones relating to "firsts" or relatively early tokens of a niche.

Each timeline contains an `images/` folder; I strive to only use the original onchain/hash-matching files for each asset mentioned, but there will be the odd exception (e.g. PEPERMANENT being displayed as a .gif rather than the entire onchain .json file).

## 0xmons Onchain In Early 2021 (Pre-XOR by Nahiko)

Only 83 0xmons had their full GAN animations onchain before Nahiko released XOR (art + algo/neural onchain) on the 9th August 2021, making them the earliest known onchain AI artworks.

## Earliest Hashed NFTs On Bitcoin (2014-2018)

~99% of early Bitcoin NFTs lacked cryptographic proof linking them to the data/art they represented. This table is about the ~1%.

## Pre-Ordinals Onchain Bitcoin NFTs

Before the first Ordinals inscription (14th December 2022) there was already a small batch of onchain Bitcoin NFTs. Here they are.
