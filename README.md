# Early NFTs

Early NFTs is a repo containing various resources focused on early NFTs (firsts, relatively early tokens of a niche etc), mostly in the form of blog posts and timelines.

### Defining an NFT

In the strictest sense, an NFT is a unique 1/1 token representing ownership of something (art etc).

In common usage however, it's used to refer to any kind of tokenized asset, nonfungible or not, that is seen as collectible outside of (generally) larger supply altcoins or memecoins.

For example, semi-fungible blockchain collectibles were first popularized on Bitcoin by both Ascribe & Spells of Genesis, before exploding in popularity when the ERC-1155 standard was released on Ethereum in 2019.

The key point is that **NFTs are ownable, tradable (except soulbound tokens) tokens that represent something**.

The entries and dates in all of the timelines found here therefore go by the earliest date where the NFT itself fully existed; it could be ownable, it could be tradable (except for soulbound tokens) and it represented something.
