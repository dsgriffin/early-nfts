### Defining an NFT

In the strict sense, an NFT is a unique 1/1 token representing ownership of something (art etc).

In common usage, however, it's used to refer to any kind of tokenized asset, nonfungible or not, that is viewed as collectible & represents ownership of something other than the token itself.

For example, semi-fungible blockchain collectibles were first popularized on Bitcoin by both Ascribe & Spells of Genesis, before exploding in popularity when the ERC-1155 standard was released on Ethereum in 2019.

The key point is that **NFTs are ownable, tradable tokens that represent something**.

The entries and dates in all of the timelines found here therefore go by the earliest date where the NFT itself fully existed; it could be owned, it could be traded (except for soulbound tokens) and it represented something.
