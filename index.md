### Defining an NFT

In the strict sense, an NFT is a unique 1/1 token representing ownership of something (art etc).

In common usage, however, it's used to refer to any kind of tokenized asset, nonfungible or not, that is viewed as collectible & represents ownership of something more than just the token itself.

For example, semi-fungible Bitcoin collectibles were first popularized by both Spells of Genesis & Ascribe, before exploding in popularity on Ethereum when the ERC-1155 standard was released in 2019.

The key point is that **NFTs are ownable, tradable tokens that represent something**.

The entries & dates in all of these timelines therefore go by the earliest date where the NFT itself fully existed; it could be owned, it could be traded (except for soulbound tokens) & it represented something.
